# Paddy App

This is the user interface component for Paddy, the Power Administration Daemon.

It uses [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/), with Capacitor for mobile deployment, and the [BLE Capacitor plugin](https://github.com/capacitor-community/bluetooth-le) to interface with the Daemon(s).

The job of this application is to serve as a neat user interface for managing Daemons in their whole lifecycle, including setup, toggling, power measurement, statistics and any necessary error handling.
